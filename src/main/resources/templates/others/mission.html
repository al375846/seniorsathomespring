        <h1>Our Mission</h1>

    <p><br></p>

    <div class="container">
        <p>We are a group of people that are developing a project commissioned by the Regional Ministry of Social Affairs (CAS), in order to improve the quality of live of elderly people. We believe that elderly would be more comfortable in their own home than in residences, but they are not always able to stay at home due to some needs. It is our aim to offer them help and companion services in order to make them possible to stay in their home.</p>

                    The services we offer are services that we believe can help us achieve our objective, such as catering or cleaning, but we are expanding the number of services as they are needed. While the company service are services that we can offer with thanks to the collaboration of the volunteers who have volunteered to participate in our project, since there are no things that a company cannot provide such as help you with the purchase, which will read a book or just listen to you and talk to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the services we offer are paid, since we hire specialized external companies, and in this way we can offer the best services, but we understand that the salary received is not too much in general, so we have prices affordable as it is not our intention that all savings be spent. On the other hand, the services offered by the volunteers are totally free since they do not do it for the money but for vocation and experience.
